Recognize each tag with patterns by assigning 0s and 1s to individual words
ie, organize input. Identify 0-1 pattern. Allocate to classes

Tokenization: Splitting a string into meaningful units  eg:["how", "are", "you", "?"]

Stemming: Generate the root form of the words
eg: "organize", "organizes", "organizing"
=>  ["organ", "organ", "organ"]

Tokenize --> lower + stemming --> exclude punctuation characters --> bag of words
